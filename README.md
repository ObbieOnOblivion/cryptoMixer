### ENHANCEMENTS AND NEXT STEPS:
* Add persistance so that `depositAddress` can be associated with the user's addresses
    - right now, there's not really such a thing as logging back in
* Find a more clever/random/secure way of generating an address
* Send an email with `depositAddress` rather than just `alert`ing it
* Clean up CSS and make use of LESS variables/mixins

* update the following:
`npm WARN deprecated babel-preset-es2015@6.24.1: ðŸ™Œ  Thanks for using Babel: we recommend using babel-preset-env now: please read babeljs.io/env to update!`
* make css prettier
    - login inputs
* get rid of Transactions.jsx cos you're not using it
